# Retail Analytics Recommender Pipeline

A scalable end‚Äëto‚Äëend data engineering and recommendation system pipeline powered by Airflow, BigQuery, dbt, and Python. This project simulates a real‚Äëworld e‚Äëcommerce recommender workflow with rich analytics and hybrid recommendation models.


## üéØ Project Objective

Build a robust ETL pipeline to ingest, clean, model and analyze sales data, culminating in personalized product recommendations. Implement collaborative and hybrid filtering approaches, and surface key KPIs via dbt models.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Components

1. **ETL (Apache Airflow)**

Implemented in `airflow/dags/retail_etl.py`, this DAG runs once per day (`@daily`) and contains four Python‚Äëbased tasks:

- **DAG ID**: `retail_etl`  
- **Tasks** (in order):

  1. **extract_data**  
     - Reads the raw CSV (`data/raw/online_retail.csv`)  
     - Writes a Parquet snapshot to `data/processed/retail.parquet`

  2. **transform_data**  
     - Loads `retail.parquet`  
     - Drops rows missing `Customer ID` and removes duplicates  
     - Parses `InvoiceDate` to¬†`datetime`  
     - Filters out cancelled orders (Invoice numbers starting with ‚ÄúC‚Äù)  
     - Calculates a `TotalPrice` column (`Quantity √ó Price`)  
     - Writes cleaned data to `data/processed/cleaned_retail.parquet`

  3. **upload_to_gcs**  
     - Uploads `cleaned_retail.parquet` to your GCS bucket (`gs://<YOUR_BUCKET>/processed/cleaned_retail.parquet`)  
     - Requires `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to be set

  4. **load_to_bigquery**  
     - Loads the Parquet file from GCS into BigQuery  
       - **Dataset**: `retail`  
       - **Table**: `sales`  
     - Uses `autodetect=True` for schema inference


2. **Analytics Models (dbt)**

Defined in the dbt/ project using modular, version-controlled SQL models.

üìê Key Models (in models/marts/):

   - **RFM Segmentation** (`rfm.sql`): Recency, Frequency, Monetary score per user
Customer segments were derived using an RFM scoring model based on the following dimensions:

      - Recency: Days since last purchase  
      - Frequency: Total number of transactions  
      - Monetary: Total revenue per customer  

Each customer is scored on a scale from 1 to 5 (using `NTILE(5)`) for each dimension

Customer segmentation was performed using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scoring, and mapped into seven behavioral segments:

| Segment Name        | Criteria (R, F, M)                    | Description                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|  Champions         | R = 5 AND F ‚â• 4 AND M ‚â• 4              | Bought recently, frequently, and spent well. |
|  Loyal Customers   | R ‚â• 4 AND F ‚â• 3                        | Frequent and recent buyers.                  |
|  Potential Loyalists | R ‚â• 3 AND F ‚â• 2 AND M ‚â• 2            | Engaged, could become loyal.                 |
|  New Customers      | R = 5 AND F = 1                       | Very recent first-time buyers.               |
|  At Risk           | R ‚â§ 2 AND F ‚â• 2 AND M ‚â• 2              | Once valuable but haven‚Äôt returned.          |
|  Hibernating        | R ‚â§ 2 AND F ‚â§ 2 AND M ‚â§ 2              | Inactive and low engagement.                 |
|  Others             | *(All other combinations)*            | Unclassified or mixed behavior patterns.     |

This segmentation was used in both analysis and dashboard filtering to highlight user lifecycle stages and tailor product recommendations.


   - **Product Performance** (`product_performance.sql`): total revenue & order frequency per `stock_code`
   - **Country Orders** (`country.sql`): number of orders & revenue by country
   - **Product Trends** (`trends.sql`): monthly time‚Äëseries of item sales
   - **Repeat Purchase Rate** (`RPR.sql`): % of returning buyers over time
Use dbt build to create these views/tables in BigQuery.

3. **Data Warehouse (BigQuery)**
   - **Raw Layer**:
     `sales` ‚Äî populated directly from the ETL DAG using Parquet ‚Üí GCS ‚Üí BigQuery

   - **Staging / Marts (created by dbt)**:

`stg_sales` ‚Äî cleaned and typed staging layer

rfm, product_performance, RPR, country, trend. ‚Äî output of dbt models

BigQuery serves as the source of truth for analytics, reporting, and recommendation input features.


4. **Recommendation Engine (Python + BigQuery)**
   - **Collaborative Filtering** via `implicit` library:
     This module uses implicit feedback (e.g., purchase quantity) from user-item interactions and trains matrix factorization models like ALS, BPR, and LogisticMF to generate personalized product recommendations. Evaluation is performed using time-based and leave-one-out strategies to assess recommendation quality via precision, recall, hit rate, and MRR.
     - **ALS**: `AlternatingLeastSquares(factors=64, regularization=0.1, iterations=30)`
     - **BPR**: `BayesianPersonalizedRanking(factors=64, learning_rate=0.01, regularization=0.01, iterations=50)`
     - **LogMF**: `LogisticMatrixFactorization(factors=64, regularization=0.01, iterations=50)`
   - **Hybrid** (LightFM):
     This approach combines collaborative filtering with content-based features using the LightFM model. It learns latent factors from user-item interactions (such as the quantity purchased) and incorporates item descriptions (represented using TF-IDF) and user features (represented using an identity matrix) to improve recommendations. The model is evaluated using K-fold cross-validation, with performance metrics such as Precision@k, Recall@k, and F1 Score. The content-based features (item descriptions) are incorporated via the item_features matrix, while user features are represented using a simple identity matrix for each user.


     ```python
     from lightfm import LightFM
     model = LightFM(
       no_components=128,
       learning_rate=0.05,
       loss='warp',
       item_alpha=0.001,
       user_alpha=0.001
     )
     ```
   - **Evaluation**: Precision@5; best achieved **0.38** with LightFM hyperparameters above.
